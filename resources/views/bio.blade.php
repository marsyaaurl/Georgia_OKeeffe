                        Born on November 15, 1887, the second of seven children, <b>Georgia Totto O'Keeffe</b> grew up on a farm near Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. 
                    As a child she received art lessons at home. Her abilities were recognized and encouraged by teachers throughout her school years. 
                    By the time she graduated from high school in 1905, O'Keeffe had determined to make her way as an artist. O'Keeffe studied at the Art Institute of Chicago (1905-1906) and the Art Students League in New York (1907-1908), where she learned the techniques of traditional realist painting. 
                    In 1908, she won the League's William Merritt Chase still-life prize for her oil painting <b>Untitled (Dead Rabbit with Copper Pot)</b>.

                    <p>
                        The direction of her artistic practice shifted dramatically four years later (1912) when she took a summer course at the University of Virginia, taught by <b>Alon Bement</b> of Teachers College, Columbia University. 
                    Bement introduced her to the revolutionary ideas of his colleague Arthur Wesley Dow. Dow encouraged an intellectual and imaginative process of making art that was grounded in personal expression and harmonious design.

                    <p>
                        <i>“This man had one dominating idea,”</i> according to O'Keeffe, <i>“to fill a space in a beautiful way— and that interested me.”</i> Dow's approach offered O'Keeffe an alternative to realism, and she experimented with it for two years, while she taught art in the Amarillo, Texas public schools (1912-14) and worked summers in Virginia as Bement's assistant. 
                    O'Keeffe studied in New York from 1914 to 1915, at Teachers College, Columbia University and by the fall of 1915 she was teaching art at Columbia College, in South Carolina. She began a series of abstract charcoal drawings, to develop a personal language through which she could express her feelings and ideas.
                    ate in life she recalled, <i>“I realized that I had things in my head not like what I had been taught - not ike what I had seen - shapes and ideas so familiar to me that it hadn't occurred to me to put them down. 
                    I decided to stop painting, to put away everything I had done, and to start to say the things that were my own.”</i> She mailed some of these highly abstract drawings to a friend in New York City.
                    Her friend showed them to <b>Stieglitz</b>, the art dealer and renowned photographer, who would eventually become O'Keeffe's husband. He became the first to exhibit her work, in 1916.

                                O'Keeffe loved the forms and shapes of nature. She would walk miles in the desert sun of New Mexico, collecting rocks and sun-bleached bones.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Many of the forms she paints are simplified, and sculptural, with gently rounded corners like the adobe houses of New Mexico where she lived for many years.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                The positive and negative shapes in many of her paintings are simple and graphic. The shapes are easily distinguishable and clean, even in her paintings of the urban landscape of New York City, such as New York With Moon, (1925, 48"x30").

                                She used photography techniques like zooming and cropping. She magnified the flowers and cropped them, zooming in on them and filling the canvas, using a technique introduced by photography. By continuing to zoom in and crop her subject she created increasingly abstract compositions.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                Her paintings are void of human presence. They express the essence of her inner vision, without the distraction of human form. Much like her solitary and individualistic persona, her paintings convey a peaceful solitude.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                She was interested in scale and experimenting with it. She painted flowers much larger than life so that people would take notice and experience them the same way she did. Some of her paintings show foreground objects in grand scale, making them appear monumental, while mountains in the distance are diminutive, such as in her paintings of bones against a desert sky.

                                O'Keeffe loved bright, bold, and intense color. She would often use bright blues, yellows, greens, reds, and purples.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                She often painted using flat color, emphasizing the shape of her subject rather than three-dimensional form. Her paintings convey an even lighting, as though everything is painted at high noon.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                                O'Keeffe's landscape paintings are mostly a frontal view, showing horizontal bands of intense color, much like the hills of New Mexico.

                            <li>
                                Some of her later paintings show the influence of Surrealism, with skulls floating in the sky.

                                Her paintings are not as much about the illusion of space or form as they are about shape, line, and color. Her style of painting was influenced by Zen Buddhism and the simplicity of Japanese art, but mostly she was driven by her own unique vision to create the iconic paintings that have made her one of America's greatest painters.

                        Georgia O'Keeffe, known as the "Mother of American Modernism," earned this title through her pioneering contributions to 20th-century art. 
                        She gained recognition in the 1920s for her abstract interpretations of natural forms, particularly flowers, skyscrapers, and southwestern landscapes, which showcased her unique blend of realism and abstraction. 
                        Her innovative use of vibrant colors and large-scale depictions of flowers, magnifying their details, challenged traditional representations and drew attention to the beauty in everyday objects.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                        O'Keeffe's work was central to the development of American Modernism, a movement that broke away from European artistic traditions and sought to express a distinctly American perspective. 
                        Her ability to evoke strong emotional responses with simplified, organic forms influenced generations of American artists, pushing the boundaries of abstraction in both painting and sculpture. 
                        By embracing bold, non-traditional subjects, O'Keeffe became a symbol of independence and creativity, paving the way for future female artists to gain recognition in the male-dominated art world.
                        Her legacy continues to inspire discussions on the role of women in art and the relationship between nature and abstraction in modern artistic expression.
