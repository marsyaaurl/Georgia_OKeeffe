                    Georgia O'Keeffe was greatly influenced by Arthur Wesley
                    Dow, with whom she studied composition for two years at
                    Columbia Teachers College. In his art book, Compositions,
                    Dow told students to paint,
                </p>

                <p>
                    Liberated by Dow's unique approach to art, O'Keeffe took the
                    notions of going "beyond the mere drawing of a flower" to
                    dazzling extremes. In her large floral designs, O'Keeffe not
                    only catches the 'still object' - canvases swimming with
                    swirls of voluptuously curved, pulsating with color - but
                    also seems to dive into the very heart of the flower itself,
                    pulling the viewer in with her.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dow also stressed the importance of an "oriental aesthetic",
                    in particular, the Japanese concept of notan, where a
                    painting is composed using balance values of lights and
                    darks. In many O'Keeffe floral paintings, especially The
                    White Calico Flower, so reminiscent of The Great Wave off
                    Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai, Dow's "orientalizing"
                    influence is clearly evident. O'Keeffe would attribute Dow's
                    measured but decorative approach to composition as the basis
                    for her lifelong personal and professional compulsion to
                    'fill a space in a beautiful way.'
